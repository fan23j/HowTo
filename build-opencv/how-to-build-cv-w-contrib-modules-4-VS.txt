How to build cv w/ contribution modules for VS
 (s.wu  9/25/2020)

1. Motivation:
	Since CV offitial pre-built release does not include extra contribution modules, you need to build it by yourself.
	
2. Clone cv source repositires from github and saved them at 
	.\opencv-4.1.1\opencv_src
	.\opencv-4.1.1\opencv_src\opencv_contrib-4.1.1
	.\opencv-4.1.1\opencv_src\opencv-4.1.1

3. set cmake based on how_to_build-cv-cmake.png
   a. Config       -- set up building flags 
   note do nor forget to set: 
   OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH="C:\pkg\opencv\opencv-4.1.1\opencv_src\opencv_contrib-4.1.1\modules" 
   b. Generate     -- generate vs solution files
   c. open project -- open sln by vs2017 then build debug and release versions

>bt
Print a backtrace of the entire stack: one line per frame for all frames in the stack. You can stop the backtrace at any time by typing the system interrupt character, normally C-c.
backtrace n
>bt n
Similar, but print only the innermost n frames.
backtrace -n
>bt -n
Similar, but print only the outermost n frames.


background
The call stack is divided up into contiguous pieces called stack frames, or frames for short; each frame is the data associated with one call to one function. 
The frame contains the arguments given to the function, the function's local variables, and the address at which the function is executing.

When your program is started, the stack has only one frame, that of the function main. This is called the initial frame or the outermost frame. Each time a 
function is called, a new frame is made. Each time a function returns, the frame for that function invocation is eliminated. If a function is recursive, 
there can be many frames for the same function. The frame for the function in which execution is actually occurring is called the innermost frame. 
This is the most recently created of all the stack frames that still exist.
